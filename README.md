This repository is my learning journey into NumPy, focused on understanding how it really works, not just how to use it.

I’m exploring arrays, shapes, dtypes, memory layout, vectorization, and performance — comparing NumPy with plain Python to see why NumPy is faster and more memory-efficient.

**The goal is depth and clarity:**
to build strong fundamentals, think in arrays instead of loops, and understand the internal ideas that matter in real data and performance-critical work.

This repo grows as I learn. Code is written step by step, with experiments, mistakes, and insights along the way :-)
