# numpy-deep-dive
This repository is my learning journey into NumPy, focused on understanding how it really works, not just how to use it. I explore arrays, dtypes, memory layout, vectorization, and performance, comparing NumPy with plain Python to understand why it’s faster and more memory-efficient.
